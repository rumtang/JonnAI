    "narration": "Most organizations have deployed AI agents. But agents alone don't unlock the real economics — the ability to drive more revenue from every campaign while cutting the cost of content production and governance. That requires a shift from agents to agentic thinking: structuring your strategy, your brand standards, and your rules of engagement so that agents can execute with the same judgment your best people bring. Without that structure, you're handing execution to systems that don't understand your brand or your boundaries. Agentic thinking is how you scale AI operations without losing control.",

But without shared context, each agent tends to operate in isolation. The research agent may not know what the brand guide says. The SEO agent may not know what compliance flagged last quarter. Faster output without coherence often just creates more content to review.",

Each agent speeds up its own step, but the handoffs between them are still fragile. A significant share of marketer time still goes to coordination. The linear model doesn't reflect how work actually flows — and adding speed to a flawed structure just surfaces the cracks faster.",
