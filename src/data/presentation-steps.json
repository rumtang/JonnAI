    "narration": "Most organizations have deployed AI agents. But agents alone don't create the ability to drive more revenue while cutting production and governance costs. That requires agentic thinking: structuring your strategy, brand standards, and rules of engagement so agents execute with the same judgment your best people bring. Without that structure, you're handing execution to systems that don't understand your brand or your boundaries.",
