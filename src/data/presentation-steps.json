    "narration": "AI agents get overlaid on specific steps — research, drafting, optimization, performance analysis. That is the natural first move, and it works. But what this agent-first approach misses is that the real work depends on context: brand instincts, legal judgment calls, audience intuition that lives in your best people's heads. Most of that intelligence is mundane — routine decisions, everyday judgment calls. Codifying the mundane is exactly the point. When you make the routine explicit, agents can reason over it — and your people focus on work that actually requires them.",

Twenty inputs describing your brand voice, audience segments, legal frameworks, and orchestration rules — each connected to the agents that depend on it. Update one input, and every agent that references it picks up the change. The agents themselves will become more interchangeable — you can swap models easily. But this knowledge layer compounds. Refine one input and every agent that touches it improves simultaneously. Your competitors can buy the same models. They can't easily replicate your organization's accumulated context.",
